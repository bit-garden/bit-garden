- 👋 Hi, I’m @bit-garden
- 👀 I’m interested in mostly cross platform technologies. Currently this is with C++/Emscripten and Dart/Flutter based tools.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning C++20 and working on my certifications.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on anything really. I'll absorb anything that holds my interest.

---

I have worked on several projects, most of which were generally to challenge myself, but never really made it to production quality.

Most of the projects were game ideas, but have long since fallen into non working code.
