- 👋 Hi, I’m @bit-garden
- 👀 I’m interested in mostly cross platform technologies. Currently this is with C++/Emscripten and Dart/Flutter based tools.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning C++20 and working on my certifications.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on anything really. I'll absorb anything that holds my interest.

---

I have worked on several projects, most of which were generally to challenge myself, but never really made it to product. This mostly included games.
